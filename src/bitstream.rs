/*
The reason this bitstream generation is done in its own :
  The idea is that we eventually want a verilog file or something that describes the memory layout of the
  fpga so that the stream generation can happen automatically from hardware(memory) description.
    (could also be an extended form of arch.xml (prog_frame.xml))

  The ideal workflow would be to design a synthesisable verilog design of the FPGA (maybe even with myHDL that generates V*).
  Then to isolate the programming frame and map the bits from the frame to the features described in the arch.xml
  file so that a prog memory model can be generated for which the v*hdl user-code can then be generated (using this tool).

  Question. How do you model the different ways the programming could work?
  It is probably infeasable to think you know can allow every type of prog frame topology.
  is that why you create a mapping model? how would that work?

  fpga_prog_frame(data_input[N:0], p_clk_in){

    Then in here the *way* in which the dev describes the mapping of data_input to the memory
    topology can help us to create the bitstream.

  }
